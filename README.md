## About

- Title "Phoenix Tech Lab - Web Development and SEO Experts in Revitalizing Websites"

### About Section

There is a lot of content here if you can find a way to make it all fit. Eventually I would like to add a video as well,
but be able to use a picture in the meantime.

"We are a web development and SEO agency that specializes in rebuilding websites and rising from the ashes to a stronger
online presence. Our team of experts will design and optimize a stunning website that will help you stand out online and
increase your visibility on search engines.

Our company began in 2012 under the name LuxWay, where we started as a video production company. However, as the digital
landscape evolved, in 2015 we saw an opportunity to expand our services to include website development. In 2022, we
rebranded to Phoenix Tech Lab to reflect our new focus and mission.

Our agency was founded by Nico Plyley and Jonathan Nyquist, who bring a wealth of experience and expertise in website
development and SEO. Together, they have led Phoenix Tech Lab to become a leading agency in the industry.

We pride ourselves on our ability to understand the unique needs of each of our clients and to deliver customized
solutions that drive results. Our team of web developers and SEO experts are dedicated to creating websites that are not
only visually stunning but also optimized for search engines, resulting in a better online visibility for our clients.

We invite you to take a look at our portfolio to see the amazing websites and SEO campaigns we have created for our
clients. If you are looking to revitalize your website and improve your online presence, contact us today to schedule a
consultation."

### Blog

A link to blog post, but we will not have it yet so just a placeholder and the design should still look fluid if it is
removed for now.

### Contact Information

Our contact information and a form.

## Contact Page

Contact information and a form. No maps on the page as we don't have a physical location people can visit. But we do
have a mailing address.
